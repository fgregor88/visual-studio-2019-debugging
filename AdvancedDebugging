Influencing the debugger programmatically

Debug."something something"
Debugger."something something"

Add [DebuggerDisplay("First Name = {FirstName} Last Name = {LastName}")] for better data overview while debugging.

You can add actions to break points turning them into trace points. You can continue execution without stoping. Right click on break point and select "Actions".

Debug -> Windows -> Call stacks opens the call stack window where you can explore called functions.

Debug -> Options -> Enable Source Link support (enable this to allow VS to download source code for external nuget packages).
